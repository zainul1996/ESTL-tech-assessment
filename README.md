USER STORY 4: Better UX When Uploading Large CSV Files (Bonus)
[] I want to be able to upload a good file with 5000 entries with success.
[] I want to be able to start two concurrent uploads of files with 5000 entries in two different tabs and check that I obtain proper feedback.

USER STORY 5: UI Localization (Bonus)
[] If I change my desktop environmentâ€™s language to Chinese, I should be viewing it in English still because there are no Chinese translations. I would like to be able to get indicators that it acknowledges that the language is to be in Chinese but Chinese is not available.
